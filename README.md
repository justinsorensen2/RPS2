Explorer Mode

As a user, I should see a welcome message.
As a user, I should see the options I can pick (i.e., "rock", "paper", "scissor")
The computer should randomly decide one of the options.
You program should then decide who the winner is;
The user should then see the randomly selected option, as well as a win or lose message.

    add some validation around user input.

Adventure Mode

Create a way for the user to choose a level of difficulty, normal, impossible, or easy.

    normal should run the game as in explorer mode above
    impossible mode always chooses the winning option (if the user picked paper, the computer always select scissor)
    easy mode always chooses the losing option (if the user picked paper, then the computer always select rock)

    Allow the user to play again. hint: while loops
